download huffdecode.exe from this repository

place the two files (huffdecode.exe & secretimage.jpg) in the same directory

run the executable in a dos terminal (or emulator) by typing:

"huffdecode secretimage.jpg newfilename.jpg"

the new encrypted image will be found in "newfilename.jpg" in the same directory!
